  ## Is this going to be free forever?

  Yes and no. We're from Sawo. We offer a free plan for users who want to try out our product before committing to a paid plan. Our free plan includes some crazily good stuff.

  ## What are the limitations of the free plan?

  The free plan has some limitations compared to our paid plans. For example, you may be limited in the number of AP calls you can make per month. Additionally, some features, such as [insert features not included in the free plan], are only available in our paid plans.

  ## Can I upgrade to a paid plan later?

  Absolutely! You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time from your account dashboard. Upgrading will give you access to additional features and resources, as well as remove any limitations imposed on the free plan.

  ## What happens if I exceed the limitations of the free plan?

  If you exceed the limitations of the free plan, your service may be slowed down or stopped until the beginning of the next billing cycle. We will notify you if you are approaching or have exceeded your limits. To avoid interruptions in service, we recommend upgrading to a paid plan that better suits your needs.

  ## Do you offer discounts for non-profits or educational institutions?

  Yes, we offer discounts for non-profit organizations and educational institutions. Please contact us for more information and to determine if you are eligible for a discount.

  ## Do you offer a trial period for paid plans?

  We do not offer a traditional trial period for our paid plans. However, our free plan allows you to try out our product and get a feel for its features and capabilities. If you find that the free plan does not meet your needs, you can upgrade to a paid plan at any time.

  ## How does billing work for paid plans?

  We offer both monthly and annual billing options for our paid plans. With monthly billing, you will be charged on a recurring basis at the beginning of each billing cycle. With annual billing, you will be charged once per year at a discounted rate. You can update your billing information or cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard.
